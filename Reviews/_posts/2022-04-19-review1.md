Naughty Dog never fails to dissapoint and this was one of the best video game experiences I have ever had. They have innovated on their previous game Uncharted 4
and their double angle storytelling was incredibly well-done. 


Take it or Leave it. The only game I have played that made we want to put down the controller because I found the story revolting.
Whether it be the dim world, my unwillingness to play the Ellie boss fight or that random hospital monster. Once the credits came I was just relieved that it was all over. And I truly appreciated the experience.

To me TLOU2 wasn't the best game of the year but definitely a game that I appreciate for the risks it took. The world-building was a bit lacking and the supporting cast were non-existent.
