“Jekyll is cool. Everything is going swimmingly.” - Jassim

This blog was built using Jekyll. I am going to start keeping a blog to catalogue my works and stay productive. 

As of now, I just re-built my portfolio/intro page. Looks much better and works on mobile devices too. 

I need to continue working on my indie game and learning python. Blog post coming soon.

I have learned about ffmpeg and working with csv files in python. Stay tuned for more updates.

Updated from my iPad.
